## A beginning. <!--use headings!-->

The decision making process and organizational design of the discretionary hedge fund are under attack. 
A large portion of the industry relies on broken, pre-internet strategies that are too slow--most mispricings are quickly identified and corrected by the wide swath of factor mining algorithms that can make quicker and less biased decisions than can a portfolio manager. 
As a result, "quant" funds have outperformed discretionary funds in recent years. <!--Can you quantify the stakes?-->
Numerous discretionary funds are throwing money at big data and machine learning in an effort to stay competitive, but this pursuit creates a deluge of new information that will serve more to inundate the portfolio manager than to inform investment decisions. <!--Real client?-->

## A middle.

To solve the problem, we can use a portfolio manager's opinion not as the ultimatum, but as a feature in a broader dataset. 
To replicate this situation, we will turn to exclusive online investment forums where users post lengthy "pitches" to buy or short a stock; a few examples of these forums include Value Investors Club and SumZero. <!--In what way exclusive?-->
Through the combination of traditional valuation techniques, natural language processing, and the wisdom of the crowd, we can incorporate fundamental investment data and opinion into a systematic investment decision pipeline. <!--What do portfolio managers know that the "quant funds" don't? Why not eliminate the portfolio manager?-->
In this pipeline, a proprietary algorithm will crawl through submitted investment pitches and determine each idea's probability of outperformance based on the language incorporated into the write-up (including sentiment, objectivity, topic modeling, and key-word weightings), financial data, macro/current events and user "credibility," or accuracy based on past decisions. <!--Expand each of these details.-->

However, in the face of new facts, positions need to be re-evaluated. <!--Is this feedback with the system itself, or do you mean the natural conversation on the forums?-->
Constant calibration comes in the form of community feedback and discussion. 
Each time a user comments or rates an investment idea, the algorithm incorporates the feedback into the decision making process, re-evaluating the probability of success for a given investment idea. <!--What games are people playing on the forums?-->

## An end.

This solution should effectively operationalize a portfolio manger's opinion, removing any cognitive biases he or she might have while also providing a clear picture of which information is important to the investment decision making process. <!--Not removing biases at all; you're incorporating them.-->
If a portfolio manager makes the final decision, we lack this key information of seeing why a certain decision may have been made. <!--A bias can be toward the truth...-->
In crowdsourcing investment recommendations, we pull from a larger net of ideas and ensure a larger diversity of thought. <!--If each member of the crowd is biased, how is the crowd unbiased?-->
With all of these slight tweaks to the typical discretionary investment decision, we should be able to amplify returns, on average. 

Difficulties arise due to a lack of data around "exotic" investments (special situations, debt, M&A, warrants, etc.) that are typical of successful investment ideas in the discretionary community. <!--Fatal flaw?-->
Additional care will need to be taken to safeguard against stock pumping and insider trading.
