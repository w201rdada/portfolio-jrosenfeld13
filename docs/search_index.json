Figure 2: Hello Benjamin Franklin! Abstract of my first idea The decision-making process and organizational design of the discretionary hedge fund are under attack. A large portion of the industry relies on broken strategies that are too slow—most equity mispricings are quickly identified and corrected by the wide swath of factor mining algorithms that can make quicker and less biased decisions than can a portfolio manager. To solve the problem, we can use a portfolio manager’s opinion not as the ultimatum, but as a feature in a broader dataset. Through the combination of traditional valuation techniques, natural language processing, and the wisdom of the crowd, we can incorporate fundamental investment data and portfolio managers’ opinions into a systematic investment decision pipeline.

The decision making process and organizational design of the discretionary hedge fund are under attack. A large portion of the industry relies on broken, pre-internet strategies that are too slow–most mispricings are quickly identified and corrected by the wide swath of factor mining algorithms that can make quicker and less biased decisions than can a portfolio manager. As a result, “quant” funds have outperformed discretionary funds in recent years. Numerous discretionary funds are throwing money at big data and machine learning in an effort to stay competitive, but this pursuit creates a deluge of new information that will serve more to inundate the portfolio manager than to inform investment decisions. A middle. To solve the problem, we can use a portfolio manager’s opinion not as the ultimatum, but as a feature in a broader dataset. To replicate this situation, we will turn to exclusive online investment forums where users post lengthy “pitches” to buy or short a stock; a few examples of these forums include Value Investors Club and SumZero. Through the combination of traditional valuation techniques, natural language processing, and the wisdom of the crowd, we can incorporate fundamental investment data and opinion into a systematic investment decision pipeline. In this pipeline, a proprietary algorithm will crawl through submitted investment pitches and determine each idea’s probability of outperformance based on the language incorporated into the write-up (including sentiment, objectivity, topic modeling, and key-word weightings), financial data, macro/current events and user “credibility,” or accuracy based on past decisions. However, in the face of new facts, positions need to be re-evaluated. Constant calibration comes in the form of community feedback and discussion. Each time a user comments or rates an investment idea, the algorithm incorporates the feedback into the decision making process, re-evaluating the probability of success for a given investment idea. An end. This solution should effectively operationalize a portfolio manger’s opinion, removing any cognitive biases he or she might have while also providing a clear picture of which information is important to the investment decision making process. If a portfolio manager makes the final decision, we lack this key information of seeing why a certain decision may have been made. In crowdsourcing investment recommendations, we pull from a larger net of ideas and ensure a larger diversity of thought. With all of these slight tweaks to the typical discretionary investment decision, we should be able to amplify returns, on average. Difficulties arise due to a lack of data around “exotic” investments (special situations, debt, M&amp;A, warrants, etc.) that are typical of successful investment ideas in the discretionary community. Additional care will need to be taken to safeguard against stock pumping and insider trading. "],

Moving Forward.", " Computer Vision Systems and Analysis for Prison Safety Keywords Computer-vision, Prison, Corrections, Safety, Predict, Assault The Problem. Physical and sexual assault run rampant in correctional facilities. In the U.S., approximately 21% of male inmates are physically assaulted during a 6-month period.1 Further, between 1999 through 2008, roughly 47,500 correctional officers had been the victim of an assault or violent act.2 It’s no surprise that response-times to critical situations can be the difference between life and death in a correctional facility. Prisons take several measures to limit violence including gang research, officer training, and psychological screening; while these measures are critical, they are also expensive and time consuming. While the cat-and-mouse game between officers and inmates may never end, facility managers are always looking for new tools to diminish its prevalence. The Solution. To help solve the problem, can we leverage recent advancements in computer vision to further monitor, prevent, and predict prison and inmate activities? Detection systems can alert prison staff to respond to problems as they occur and learn behaviors that may be predictive of impending incidents. In real-time, computer-vision algorithms can detect faces, heart rates, gestures, behavioral patterns, and other suspicious movements of all inmates. While individuals can be detected and tracked, so too can groups. A “social network” can be constructed to identify gangs and detect large gatherings of members. In an analytical setting, correctional facility administrators can later utilize the spatially-mapped data to optimize prison layouts and staff locations while reducing/identifying blind-spots for further preventative measures. Specifically, patterns will emerge over time around when and where certain behavior occurs, where staffing weaknesses arise, and where “hot spots” tend to cluster; this data can be used to influence existing/future architectural decisions and optimize staff rotations. Most facilities already have an extensive CCTV network of cameras in place. A simple rollout of our software on top of existing infrastructure will come complete with a new dashboard, computer-vision algorithms, alerts, and spatial-mapping abilities and analysis. Facility managers and officers will be trained to use all aspects of the program. Similar use of computer-vision has been applied in areas with extensive surveillance already in place, like casinos and airports. Although the technology is still nascent, success in these adjacent industries proves the project’s viability. Moving Forward. The use of this technology should unequivocally have a positive impact on increasing productivity while reducing prison violence and misconduct. Indirect economic benefits should also arise: a safer prison environment translates to reduced medical costs, less officer turnover, and reduced hiring/training costs. As this technology proliferates through correctional facilities, privacy concerns may arise in the general public–only a few simple tweaks would be necessary to move these systems out into city streets. In a correctional facility–even where our privacy concerns are minimized–it is paramount that we engage in debate to understand the extent to which inmates, officers, and the public feel the technology should be utilized. The outcome of these discussions can pave the way for proper management of a computer-vision system which can have a large, positive effect on minimizing costs and reducing prison violence, helping to ensure the safety of all.
